## ESLint Fixes Checklist ⚠️

**If this PR includes ESLint warning fixes, verify the following:**

### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] **Root cause addressed**: Changes fix the underlying issue, not just suppress warnings
- [ ] **No workarounds used**: No underscore prefixes, fake references, or hacky solutions
- [ ] **Configuration over suppression**: Checked if this could be solved by updating ESLint config
- [ ] **Justified disable comments**: Any `eslint-disable` comments are specific to the rule and well-documented
- [ ] **No runtime impact**: Changes don't affect application behavior or performance
- [ ] **Long-term maintainable**: Fixes are sustainable and won't cause future issues

### Acceptable Solutions Used
- [ ] **Removed truly unused code** (functions, variables, imports)
- [ ] **Used targeted eslint-disable** with clear explanations when necessary
- [ ] **Updated ESLint configuration** for legitimate false positives
- [ ] **Refactored code** to eliminate the warning properly

### Documentation & Testing
- [ ] **Documented unusual patterns**: Explained why variables appear unused but are necessary
- [ ] **Verified runtime behavior**: Application still works correctly
- [ ] **Checked error handling**: Error handling paths aren't broken
- [ ] **Manual testing completed**: Tested affected functionality manually

### Examples of Changes Made
**Describe the specific ESLint fixes made and why each approach was chosen:**

```javascript
// Example:
// ❌ Before: const _unusedVar = getData();
// ✅ After: Removed unused variable entirely
```
